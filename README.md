## Motivation and Type of Job I'm Looking For:
During my education in engineering I came across several programming languages. It was evident to me, then, that programming was something that I liked very much to do and I ended up choosing all classes related with Industrial Informatics during my Masters. Unfortunately, I didn’t have the opportunity to find a job where I could pursue software development as I was my intention and I ended up doing a PhD in engineering although it wasn’t my true passion, but was something that I didn’t dislike and that could pay my bills. Now, older and hopefully wiser, I had the opportunity to step back and think what I want to do with my career and I decided to focus on something that I really like, while I still can. I have the passion, I have brains and I definitely am motivated, so I know I can pursue what I really would like to work on the rest of my life: software development.  
I'm very interested in programming, specially related to android/iOS applications, I'm using all my free time to deepen my knowledge in these subjects. So you can expect a hard working person, very focused in learning these skills. 
Programming is something that I love to learn and apply, so it is as people say: "Do something that you love and you won't have to ‘work’ one more day of your life".
I’m looking for a place where I can learn more about programming, in an environment where I can be in contact with established software developers so that I work towards becoming one myself. An apprenticeship or a trainee position would be ideal.


## Java Project #1: Game_1
My fist java project published in this portfolio. This sample project was to create a sample of a game showing some of the tools and java API I learned.
This game is completely original and 100% made by me.
The Project was executed using Eclipse IDE. The pixel art was provided by "OpenGameArt.com".
A executable .jar file is provided to try the game directly.
In this Project I used:
  - Java AWT;
  - Java Swing (constructed by hand, not using window builder);
  - Multithreading;
  - Polymorphism;
  - Writing and reading files (the save/load option);
  - Getters and Setters;
  - Java Graphics;
  - Animations;
  - etc...
